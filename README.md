## Build problem with gradle wrapper

EDIT:2025.04.05

it seems you have to update

```(Ghidra Install Dir)\Ghidra\application.properties```

and upgrade the gradle version like this

```application.gradle.min=8.10```

if you have problems with building from source in eclipse with the gradle wrapper.
